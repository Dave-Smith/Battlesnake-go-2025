Here's how it works:\n\n1. The main `calculateNextMove` function evaluates all possible moves and returns the best one based on a scoring system.\n\n2. Key features implemented:\n   - Avoids board boundaries and collisions with snake bodies\n   - Only seeks food when health is low (< 25)\n   - Attacks shorter opponents while avoiding longer ones\n   - Evaluates and avoids dead ends using a depth-first approach\n   - Avoids hazards on the board\n   - Implements a scoring system for move evaluation\n\n3. The scoring system considers:\n   - Base move validity (within bounds, no collisions)\n   - Distance to food (attractive when health is low, slightly repulsive when health is good)\n   - Proximity to opponents (aggressive or defensive based on length comparison)\n   - Hazard avoidance\n   - Dead end evaluation\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Add it to your Battlesnake project\n2. In your main handler, parse the incoming request into the GameState struct\n3. Call `calculateNextMove(gameState)` to get the next move\n4. Return the move in your API response\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add any additional strategies or behaviors?\n2. Modify the scoring weights for different factors?\n3. Add more sophisticated path-finding algorithms?\n4. Implement any other specific game mechanics?",

Here's how it works:\n\n1. The main `calculateNextMove` function evaluates all possible moves and returns the best one based on a scoring system.\n\n2. Key features implemented:\n   - Avoids board boundaries and collisions with snake bodies\n   - Only seeks food when health is low (< 25)\n   - Attacks shorter opponents while avoiding longer ones\n   - Evaluates and avoids dead ends using a depth-first approach\n   - Avoids hazards on the board\n   - Implements a scoring system for move evaluation\n\n3. The scoring system considers:\n   - Base move validity (within bounds, no collisions)\n   - Distance to food (attractive when health is low, slightly repulsive when health is good)\n   - Proximity to opponents (aggressive or defensive based on length comparison)\n   - Hazard avoidance\n   - Dead end evaluation\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Add it to your Battlesnake project\n2. In your main handler, parse the incoming request into the GameState struct\n3. Call `calculateNextMove(gameState)` to get the next move\n4. Return the move in your API response\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add any additional strategies or behaviors?\n2. Modify the scoring weights for different factors?\n3. Add more sophisticated path-finding algorithms?\n4. Implement any other specific game mechanics?"

Added `calculateOpponentNextMoves`:\n   - Predicts all possible next positions for each opponent snake\n   - Takes into account board boundaries and other obstacles\n   - Returns a map of snake IDs to their possible next positions\n\n2. Added `isHeadToHeadCollision`:\n   - Checks if our next move could result in a head-to-head collision\n   - Considers snake lengths to determine if collision would be fatal\n   - Returns true only for dangerous collisions (equal or longer snakes)\n\n3. Enhanced `calculateNextMove`:\n   - Now predicts opponent movements before evaluating moves\n   - Completely avoids dangerous head-to-head situations when possible\n   - Has a fallback strategy when no safe moves are available\n   - Still allows head-to-head collisions with shorter snakes (as this would result in a win)\n\nThe logic now works like this:\n1. First, calculate all possible moves for opponent snakes\n2. For each possible move our snake could make:\n   - Check if it's valid (within bounds, no body collisions)\n   - Check if it could result in a head-to-head collision with a dangerous opponent\n   - If safe, evaluate the move's score considering other factors\n3. If no safe moves are found, fall back to accepting risky moves with a heavy penalty\n4. Finally, choose the highest-scoring valid move\n\nThis approach should significantly reduce dangerous head-to-head collisions while still allowing aggressive moves against shorter snakes when advantageous.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add more sophisticated opponent movement prediction?\n2. Modify the scoring weights for different types of collisions?\n3. Add visualization of predicted opponent moves for debugging?\n4. Implement any other collision avoidance strategies?",

Added `calculateOpponentNextMoves`:\n   - Predicts all possible next positions for each opponent snake\n   - Takes into account board boundaries and other obstacles\n   - Returns a map of snake IDs to their possible next positions\n\n2. Added `isHeadToHeadCollision`:\n   - Checks if our next move could result in a head-to-head collision\n   - Considers snake lengths to determine if collision would be fatal\n   - Returns true only for dangerous collisions (equal or longer snakes)\n\n3. Enhanced `calculateNextMove`:\n   - Now predicts opponent movements before evaluating moves\n   - Completely avoids dangerous head-to-head situations when possible\n   - Has a fallback strategy when no safe moves are available\n   - Still allows head-to-head collisions with shorter snakes (as this would result in a win)\n\nThe logic now works like this:\n1. First, calculate all possible moves for opponent snakes\n2. For each possible move our snake could make:\n   - Check if it's valid (within bounds, no body collisions)\n   - Check if it could result in a head-to-head collision with a dangerous opponent\n   - If safe, evaluate the move's score considering other factors\n3. If no safe moves are found, fall back to accepting risky moves with a heavy penalty\n4. Finally, choose the highest-scoring valid move\n\nThis approach should significantly reduce dangerous head-to-head collisions while still allowing aggressive moves against shorter snakes when advantageous.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add more sophisticated opponent movement prediction?\n2. Modify the scoring weights for different types of collisions?\n3. Add visualization of predicted opponent moves for debugging?\n4. Implement any other collision avoidance strategies?"

Created a new `OpponentPredictor` struct that provides sophisticated opponent analysis:\n   - Predicts opponent moves based on their current state and behavior patterns\n   - Analyzes each snake's intent (seeking food, aggressive mode, trapped)\n   - Calculates probability weights for each possible move\n\n2. Enhanced collision risk calculation:\n   - Now uses probability-based risk assessment instead of binary collision detection\n   - Takes into account snake lengths and behavioral patterns\n   - Considers opponent intentions (aggressive, trapped, seeking food)\n   - Adjusts risk based on multiple factors\n\n3. Improved move evaluation:\n   - Scores are now adjusted based on calculated collision risks\n   - Better handling of situations where all moves have some risk\n   - More nuanced approach to head-to-head situations\n\nThe new prediction system considers:\n1. Snake health and food-seeking behavior\n2. Aggressive behavior patterns\n3. Trapped or cornered situations\n4. Multiple possible moves with weighted probabilities\n5. Complex interactions between multiple snakes\n\nThe collision risk calculation now:\n1. Uses probability-based risk assessment\n2. Considers snake lengths more carefully\n3. Takes into account opponent intentions\n4. Provides more granular risk levels\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add more behavioral patterns to the prediction system?\n2. Fine-tune the risk calculation weights?\n3. Add additional strategic considerations?\n4. Implement any specific scenarios you've noticed causing problems?",

Created a new `OpponentPredictor` struct that provides sophisticated opponent analysis:\n   - Predicts opponent moves based on their current state and behavior patterns\n   - Analyzes each snake's intent (seeking food, aggressive mode, trapped)\n   - Calculates probability weights for each possible move\n\n2. Enhanced collision risk calculation:\n   - Now uses probability-based risk assessment instead of binary collision detection\n   - Takes into account snake lengths and behavioral patterns\n   - Considers opponent intentions (aggressive, trapped, seeking food)\n   - Adjusts risk based on multiple factors\n\n3. Improved move evaluation:\n   - Scores are now adjusted based on calculated collision risks\n   - Better handling of situations where all moves have some risk\n   - More nuanced approach to head-to-head situations\n\nThe new prediction system considers:\n1. Snake health and food-seeking behavior\n2. Aggressive behavior patterns\n3. Trapped or cornered situations\n4. Multiple possible moves with weighted probabilities\n5. Complex interactions between multiple snakes\n\nThe collision risk calculation now:\n1. Uses probability-based risk assessment\n2. Considers snake lengths more carefully\n3. Takes into account opponent intentions\n4. Provides more granular risk levels\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add more behavioral patterns to the prediction system?\n2. Fine-tune the risk calculation weights?\n3. Add additional strategic considerations?\n4. Implement any specific scenarios you've noticed causing problems?"

Here's how the new scoring works, in order of priority:\n\n1. **Critical Safety Checks** (Immediate Disqualification):\n   - Immediate head-to-head collisions with larger/equal snakes: Score of -1000\n   - Moves that lead to trapped positions: Score of -800\n   - These effectively prevent the snake from making fatal moves\n\n2. **Hazard Avoidance**:\n   - Applies a 50% penalty multiplier for moving into hazards\n   - Makes hazards very unattractive unless absolutely necessary\n\n3. **Food Evaluation** (Much Safer Now):\n   - Only considers food if:\n     - Health is very low (<25): Desperate mode, will take some risks\n     - Health is medium (<50): Only goes for safe food\n     - Health is high: Only goes for very safe, nearby food\n   - Carefully checks if other snakes can reach the food\n   - Won't move for food if a larger snake can also reach it\n\n4. **Space Evaluation**:\n   - Uses flood fill to calculate available space\n   - Heavily weights moves that lead to more open space\n   - Helps avoid getting trapped or cornered\n\n5. **Tactical Positioning**:\n   - Aggressive positioning only against significantly smaller snakes\n   - Defensive positioning against larger snakes\n   - Maintains safe distance from threats\n\nKey Improvements:\n1. Much more conservative about food gathering\n2. Better evaluation of dangerous situations\n3. Stronger emphasis on available space\n4. Clearer separation between different scoring factors\n5. Better handling of trapped positions\n\nThe scoring system now uses a hierarchical approach:\n1. First rules out deadly moves\n2. Then evaluates safety factors\n3. Only then considers opportunistic moves (food, aggressive plays)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Adjust any of the scoring weights?\n2. Add more safety checks?\n3. Modify the food-seeking behavior further?\n4. Add additional tactical considerations?",

Here's how the new scoring works, in order of priority:\n\n1. **Critical Safety Checks** (Immediate Disqualification):\n   - Immediate head-to-head collisions with larger/equal snakes: Score of -1000\n   - Moves that lead to trapped positions: Score of -800\n   - These effectively prevent the snake from making fatal moves\n\n2. **Hazard Avoidance**:\n   - Applies a 50% penalty multiplier for moving into hazards\n   - Makes hazards very unattractive unless absolutely necessary\n\n3. **Food Evaluation** (Much Safer Now):\n   - Only considers food if:\n     - Health is very low (<25): Desperate mode, will take some risks\n     - Health is medium (<50): Only goes for safe food\n     - Health is high: Only goes for very safe, nearby food\n   - Carefully checks if other snakes can reach the food\n   - Won't move for food if a larger snake can also reach it\n\n4. **Space Evaluation**:\n   - Uses flood fill to calculate available space\n   - Heavily weights moves that lead to more open space\n   - Helps avoid getting trapped or cornered\n\n5. **Tactical Positioning**:\n   - Aggressive positioning only against significantly smaller snakes\n   - Defensive positioning against larger snakes\n   - Maintains safe distance from threats\n\nKey Improvements:\n1. Much more conservative about food gathering\n2. Better evaluation of dangerous situations\n3. Stronger emphasis on available space\n4. Clearer separation between different scoring factors\n5. Better handling of trapped positions\n\nThe scoring system now uses a hierarchical approach:\n1. First rules out deadly moves\n2. Then evaluates safety factors\n3. Only then considers opportunistic moves (food, aggressive plays)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Adjust any of the scoring weights?\n2. Add more safety checks?\n3. Modify the food-seeking behavior further?\n4. Add additional tactical considerations?"

Added `calculateOptimalLength`:\n   - Calculates ideal snake length based on other snakes\n   - Ensures we're not the shortest snake (minimum of shortest snake + 1)\n   - Caps maximum length at 8 to maintain maneuverability\n   - Takes into account average snake length\n\n2. Enhanced food-seeking behavior:\n   - Urgent food seeking when health < 25\n   - Strategic food seeking when below optimal length\n   - Actively avoids food when above optimal length\n   - Still maintains all safety checks for food gathering\n\n3. Added tail-chasing behavior:\n   - Encourages following our own tail when at optimal length\n   - Helps maintain compact form when not seeking food\n   - Makes it easier to make quick turns and avoid traps\n\n4. Modified space evaluation:\n   - Increased weight on space when at or above optimal length\n   - Helps maintain maneuverability even when longer\n\nThe strategy now works like this:\n1. Initially tries to grow to be slightly longer than the shortest opponent\n2. Once at optimal length, focuses on tail-chasing and maintaining position\n3. Only grows longer if:\n   - Health is critically low\n   - We've fallen below the shortest snake's length\n   - We can safely do so without compromising maneuverability\n\nThis should help maintain a competitive length while staying agile enough to survive in tight spaces.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Adjust the optimal length calculation?\n2. Modify the tail-chasing behavior?\n3. Fine-tune the food avoidance scores?\n4. Add more sophisticated length-based strategies?",

Added `calculateOptimalLength`:\n   - Calculates ideal snake length based on other snakes\n   - Ensures we're not the shortest snake (minimum of shortest snake + 1)\n   - Caps maximum length at 8 to maintain maneuverability\n   - Takes into account average snake length\n\n2. Enhanced food-seeking behavior:\n   - Urgent food seeking when health < 25\n   - Strategic food seeking when below optimal length\n   - Actively avoids food when above optimal length\n   - Still maintains all safety checks for food gathering\n\n3. Added tail-chasing behavior:\n   - Encourages following our own tail when at optimal length\n   - Helps maintain compact form when not seeking food\n   - Makes it easier to make quick turns and avoid traps\n\n4. Modified space evaluation:\n   - Increased weight on space when at or above optimal length\n   - Helps maintain maneuverability even when longer\n\nThe strategy now works like this:\n1. Initially tries to grow to be slightly longer than the shortest opponent\n2. Once at optimal length, focuses on tail-chasing and maintaining position\n3. Only grows longer if:\n   - Health is critically low\n   - We've fallen below the shortest snake's length\n   - We can safely do so without compromising maneuverability\n\nThis should help maintain a competitive length while staying agile enough to survive in tight spaces.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Adjust the optimal length calculation?\n2. Modify the tail-chasing behavior?\n3. Fine-tune the food avoidance scores?\n4. Add more sophisticated length-based strategies?"
