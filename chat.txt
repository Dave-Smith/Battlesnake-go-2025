Me:
I am creating a API app using Go to control a playing in battlesnakes. Use the API request body below can you generate the logic code determine the next move. the possible options are up, down, left, right. The snake should avoid eating food until its health is low and needs to eat food. It should attack opponents nearby when the opponent has a shorter length. It should avoid moving towards dead end tunnels, and should not move off the board. It also needs to avoid running into other snake bodies

Response:
I'll help you create a Go function to determine the next move for your Battlesnake based on the given requirements and game state.
Battlesnake Movement LogicClick to open code
I've created a comprehensive movement logic system for your Battlesnake that implements all the requirements you mentioned. Here's how it works:

The main calculateNextMove function evaluates all possible moves and returns the best one based on a scoring system.
Key features implemented:

Avoids board boundaries and collisions with snake bodies
Only seeks food when health is low (< 25)
Attacks shorter opponents while avoiding longer ones
Evaluates and avoids dead ends using a depth-first approach
Avoids hazards on the board
Implements a scoring system for move evaluation


The scoring system considers:

Base move validity (within bounds, no collisions)
Distance to food (attractive when health is low, slightly repulsive when health is good)
Proximity to opponents (aggressive or defensive based on length comparison)
Hazard avoidance
Dead end evaluation



To use this code:

Add it to your Battlesnake project
In your main handler, parse the incoming request into the GameState struct
Call calculateNextMove(gameState) to get the next move
Return the move in your API response



Me:
can you include code to return an http response with the following json body
{ "move": "up", "shout": "I guess I'll go up then."}



Response:
I'll add an HTTP handler function to return the move response in the correct format.
Battlesnake Movement Logic with HTTP HandlerClick to open code
I've added the HTTP handler functionality at the top of the file. Here's what's new:

Added a MoveResponse struct to match the required JSON response format:

goCopytype MoveResponse struct {
    Move  string `json:"move"`
    Shout string `json:"shout"`
}

Added a HandleMove function that:

Parses the incoming JSON request into our GameState struct
Calls calculateNextMove to determine the next move
Creates and returns the response in the correct format



To use this in your main application, you would set up the HTTP server like this:
goCopyfunc main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/move", HandleMove)
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "8080"
    }
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil))
}
The handler will now:

Receive POST requests at the /move endpoint
Process the game state and calculate the next move
Return a JSON response in the format you specified


Me:
can you add to the calculateNextMove method a way to detect and avoid head to head collisions



Response:
I'll enhance the calculateNextMove method to better handle head-to-head collision detection and avoidance.
Battlesnake Movement Logic with Enhanced Collision AvoidanceClick to open code
I've made several improvements to the head-to-head collision avoidance:

Added calculateOpponentNextMoves:

Predicts all possible next positions for each opponent snake
Takes into account board boundaries and other obstacles
Returns a map of snake IDs to their possible next positions


Added isHeadToHeadCollision:

Checks if our next move could result in a head-to-head collision
Considers snake lengths to determine if collision would be fatal
Returns true only for dangerous collisions (equal or longer snakes)


Enhanced calculateNextMove:

Now predicts opponent movements before evaluating moves
Completely avoids dangerous head-to-head situations when possible
Has a fallback strategy when no safe moves are available
Still allows head-to-head collisions with shorter snakes (as this would result in a win)



The logic now works like this:

First, calculate all possible moves for opponent snakes
For each possible move our snake could make:

Check if it's valid (within bounds, no body collisions)
Check if it could result in a head-to-head collision with a dangerous opponent
If safe, evaluate the move's score considering other factors


If no safe moves are found, fall back to accepting risky moves with a heavy penalty
Finally, choose the highest-scoring valid move

This approach should significantly reduce dangerous head-to-head collisions while still allowing aggressive moves against shorter snakes when advantageous.



Me:
In testing this, I seem to lose in head to head collisions consistently. Can you add some more advanced opponent prediction


Response:
I'll enhance the opponent prediction logic to be more sophisticated and better at avoiding fatal collisions.
Battlesnake Movement Logic with Advanced Opponent PredictionClick to open code
I've made several major improvements to the opponent prediction and collision avoidance:

Created a new OpponentPredictor struct that provides sophisticated opponent analysis:

Predicts opponent moves based on their current state and behavior patterns
Analyzes each snake's intent (seeking food, aggressive mode, trapped)
Calculates probability weights for each possible move


Enhanced collision risk calculation:

Now uses probability-based risk assessment instead of binary collision detection
Takes into account snake lengths and behavioral patterns
Considers opponent intentions (aggressive, trapped, seeking food)
Adjusts risk based on multiple factors


Improved move evaluation:

Scores are now adjusted based on calculated collision risks
Better handling of situations where all moves have some risk
More nuanced approach to head-to-head situations



The new prediction system considers:

Snake health and food-seeking behavior
Aggressive behavior patterns
Trapped or cornered situations
Multiple possible moves with weighted probabilities
Complex interactions between multiple snakes

The collision risk calculation now:

Uses probability-based risk assessment
Considers snake lengths more carefully
Takes into account opponent intentions
Provides more granular risk levels



Me:
Can you explain the scoring how each decision factors into determining the move? I seem to have head collisions quite often when moving into a space occupied by food. I want to make certain death situations less likely to occur


Response:
Let me explain the current scoring system and then enhance it to make dangerous food situations less likely. Currently, there are multiple scoring factors that sometimes compete with each other, which could lead to risky decisions. Let's improve this.
Battlesnake Movement Logic with Enhanced Safety ScoringClick to open code
I've completely revamped the scoring system to make it much safer and clearer. Here's how the new scoring works, in order of priority:

Critical Safety Checks (Immediate Disqualification):

Immediate head-to-head collisions with larger/equal snakes: Score of -1000
Moves that lead to trapped positions: Score of -800
These effectively prevent the snake from making fatal moves


Hazard Avoidance:

Applies a 50% penalty multiplier for moving into hazards
Makes hazards very unattractive unless absolutely necessary


Food Evaluation (Much Safer Now):

Only considers food if:

Health is very low (<25): Desperate mode, will take some risks
Health is medium (<50): Only goes for safe food
Health is high: Only goes for very safe, nearby food


Carefully checks if other snakes can reach the food
Won't move for food if a larger snake can also reach it


Space Evaluation:

Uses flood fill to calculate available space
Heavily weights moves that lead to more open space
Helps avoid getting trapped or cornered


Tactical Positioning:

Aggressive positioning only against significantly smaller snakes
Defensive positioning against larger snakes
Maintains safe distance from threats



Key Improvements:

Much more conservative about food gathering
Better evaluation of dangerous situations
Stronger emphasis on available space
Clearer separation between different scoring factors
Better handling of trapped positions

The scoring system now uses a hierarchical approach:

First rules out deadly moves
Then evaluates safety factors
Only then considers opportunistic moves (food, aggressive plays)


Me:
Can you modify the food seeking behavior. Ideally I shouldn't be the shortest snake on the board since that would always leave me in a defensive situation. But it is good to have a small body so I can move in a tail-chasing pattern when not seeking food


Response:
I'll modify the food-seeking behavior to maintain an optimal length while avoiding unnecessary growth.
Battlesnake Movement Logic with Optimized Food StrategyClick to open code
I've made significant changes to the food-seeking strategy:

Added calculateOptimalLength:

Calculates ideal snake length based on other snakes
Ensures we're not the shortest snake (minimum of shortest snake + 1)
Caps maximum length at 8 to maintain maneuverability
Takes into account average snake length


Enhanced food-seeking behavior:

Urgent food seeking when health < 25
Strategic food seeking when below optimal length
Actively avoids food when above optimal length
Still maintains all safety checks for food gathering


Added tail-chasing behavior:

Encourages following our own tail when at optimal length
Helps maintain compact form when not seeking food
Makes it easier to make quick turns and avoid traps


Modified space evaluation:

Increased weight on space when at or above optimal length
Helps maintain maneuverability even when longer



The strategy now works like this:

Initially tries to grow to be slightly longer than the shortest opponent
Once at optimal length, focuses on tail-chasing and maintaining position
Only grows longer if:

Health is critically low
We've fallen below the shortest snake's length
We can safely do so without compromising maneuverability



This should help maintain a competitive length while staying agile enough to survive in tight spaces.



Me:
this works very well against a good player and another instance of the same snake. one test showed a questionable choice to move into a dead end instead of moving into the coordinate currently occupied by the tail of another snake. see the last 3 moves of of this test game. the snake with name Claudia turned right, into a dead end tunnel instead of left which was occupied by Cal's tail and would have been an open space to move into. Can you adjust for this scenario



Response:
I'll enhance the space evaluation to better handle tail positions of other snakes, since those spaces will become available next turn.
Battlesnake Movement Logic with Enhanced Space EvaluationClick to open code
I've made several key improvements to handle tail positions better:

Modified isValidMove:

Now checks if a snake is about to eat food (which would prevent its tail from moving)
Ignores tail positions that will move next turn
Still blocks tail positions of snakes that are about to grow


Added createStateWithMovedTails:

Creates a modified version of the game state
Removes tail positions that will move next turn
Keeps tail positions for snakes that are about to grow
Used for more accurate space evaluation


Enhanced evaluateAvailableSpace:

Uses the modified state with moved tails
Gives a more accurate count of available spaces
Considers spaces that will become available next turn


Updated isTrappedPosition:

Also uses the modified state with moved tails
Slightly increased the minimum space requirement
Better at identifying actual dead ends vs temporary blockages



This should prevent the snake from:

Mistaking a space with a moving tail for a dead end
Choosing a real dead end over a space that will open up
Getting trapped because it didn't consider future free spaces

The snake will now:

Recognize tail positions as valid moves unless the snake is about to grow
Better evaluate available space by including soon-to-be-free tail positions
Make more accurate decisions about what constitutes a trapped position
